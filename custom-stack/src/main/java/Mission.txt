Define a generic class, let's call it Stack, that represents the custom stack data structure.
This class should have methods to add (push) elements onto the stack, remove (pop) elements from the stack,
check if the stack is empty, and get the size of the stack.

Implement the push method to add elements to the top of the stack.
You can use a dynamic data structure like an ArrayList or LinkedList to store the elements.

Implement the pop method to remove and return the top element from the stack.
Implement a method to check if the stack is empty and return a boolean indicating its status.
Implement a method to get the size of the stack and return the number of elements currently in the stack.

Test your custom stack implementation with various data types and verify that it follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)
principle.
